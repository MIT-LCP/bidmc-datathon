With AdaBoost, we modified the data to focus on hard to classify observations. We can imagine this as a form of resampling the data for each new tree. For example, say we have three observations: A, B, and C, `[A, B, C]`. If we correctly classify observations `[A, B]`, but incorrectly classify `C`, then AdaBoost involves building a new tree that focuses on `C`. Equivalently, we could say AdaBoost builds a new tree using the dataset `[A, B, C, C, C]`, where we have *intentionally* repeated observation `C` 3 times so that the algorithm thinks it is 3 times as important as the other observations. Makes sense?\n","\n","Bagging involves the same approach, except we don't selectively choose which observations to focus on, but rather we *randomly select subsets of data each time*.

Gradient boosting also borrows the concept of sub-sampling the variables (just like Random Forests), which can help to prevent overfitting.\n","\n","While it is hard to express in this non-technical tutorial, the biggest innovation in gradient boosting is that it provides a unifying mathematical framework for boosting models. The approach explicitly casts the problem of building a tree as an optimization problem, defining mathematical functions for how well a tree is performing (which we had before) *and* how complex a tree is. In this light, one can actually treat AdaBoost as a \"special case\" of gradient boosting, where the loss function is chosen to be the exponential loss.\n","\n","Let's build a gradient boosting model."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"L_QVZ9oNfnqk","colab":{}},"source":["np.random.seed(321)\n","mdl = ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=10)\n","mdl = mdl.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","plt.figure(figsize=[9,5])\n","txt = 'Gradient boosted tree (final decision surface)'\n","dtn.plot_model_pred_2d(mdl, X_train, y_train, title=txt)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"tcCzP4gAsd7L"},"source":["## Comparing model performance\n","\n","We've now learned the basics of the various tree methods and have visualized most of them.

This can be done a number of ways. A simple but effective approach is to use bootstrapping, a resampling technique. In bootstrapping, we generate multiple datasets from the test set (allowing the same data point to be sampled multiple times). Using these datasets, we can then estimate the confidence intervals."]}]}
